# Generic Double Linked List With Sentinel

This is a implementation of a Generic linked list written completely in Pure C, Yeah !, you heard it, pure C :D 
Nah, seriously, this was used in another project that I worked on with other people ( www.github.com/rickftime/diskator ), great guys btw.. anyway, this library was kind of the project`s core and it was throughly tested. So far, so good. The header file is all commented in Portuguese-Br, if it is requested, I can translate it to English.. but you can also fork it and later on we can merge it :D  

Do I need a Portuguese translation ?
